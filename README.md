## Ideas on application improvements (which would have extended the deadline)
### Tech stack:
1. Unit tests!!!
2. ESLint. I initially setup it but it was slowing down the work too much so I disabled it :(
3. Better typescript interfaces. (I'm a TS newbie with a deadline, so some of the prop types are 'any')

## Features and UI/UX
1. Better error handling for wrong user city input
2. Have city autocomplete option from a dropdown menu, when user is typing
3. Fancier and sleeker design
